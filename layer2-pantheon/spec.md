# Layer-2 — PANTHEON (Multi-Perspective Engine) Specification

## Scope

Coordinates multiple reasoning chambers while preserving a shared Layer-0 backbone and explicit tension tracking.

## Invariants

1. All chambers inherit Layer-0 constraints
2. No silent divergence between chambers
3. Ledger coherence across perspectives

## Dependency Contract

- `layer1-cathedral`

## Exit Criteria

- All required artifacts exist and are non-empty.
- Invariants above are represented in implementation and documentation.
- Validation tooling reports no errors.
