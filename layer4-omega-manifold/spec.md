# Layer-4 — Ω-Manifold (Geometric Representation) Specification

## Scope

Geometric/topological mapping of stack flow and contraction fields for advanced analysis and visualization.

## Invariants

1. Coordinate transforms are explicit
2. Geometry preserves layer identity
3. Dissipativity gradients remain valid

## Dependency Contract

- `layer3-omegaomega`

## Exit Criteria

- All required artifacts exist and are non-empty.
- Invariants above are represented in implementation and documentation.
- Validation tooling reports no errors.
